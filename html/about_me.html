    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Origin</h2>
    <p>
        Hello, my name is Tyler Beaujeu. I was born in Washington and raised in Utah.
        I started playing with HTML late into my 9th grade year. I was making a site with flash games on it, kind of like armor games.
        I started this site (gameskillet) using weebly, and added games to it using embed HTML. When I started my web-design class, I
        felt like what I was learning was pretty cool. So, I decided to take as many computer related classes as I could through high school.
        I did this because I felt like I should get a broad knowledge of what I was getting into. Now I am taking a class at MATC for web-design
        and development. I am enjoying being able to learn something new and interesting about web development at MATC every day.
